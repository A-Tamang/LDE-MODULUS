# [WIP] LDE-Modulus_Solver

Synopsis:

             A Linear Diophantine/Modulus Equation Solver made in Python. 

Purpose:

             This program can evaluate any LDE (Linear Diophantine Equation)
             or Modulus Equation and provide a solution (or declare that
             there is no solution to be found). 

Instructions:

             To use, simply run the run the program on PythonIDLE (as it has a larger 
             screen for text to show up) and follow the instructions.

Updates:

             V.1.0 - LDE section is complete (not fully tested), Modulus section is 90% complete
             V.1.1 - Modulo reduction function added

Future Updates:
             
              i) Ferverously test to find errors
             ii) Show "particular solutions" as well as complete solutions
            iii) Be able to accept negative Modulo (currently not integrated)
             iv) Make into webpage with a clean interface
              v) Seperate into clear-cut modules for future usage
