# LDE-MODULUS
A Linear Diophantine/Modulus Equation Solver made in Python. 

[Work in Progress]

Purpose:
This program can evaluate any LDE (Linear Diophantine Equation)
or Modulus Equation and provide a solution (or declare that
there is no solution to be found). 

Instructions:
To use, simply run the run the program on PythonIDLE (as it has a larger 
screen for text to show up) and follow the instructions.

Future updates : Show "particular solutions" as well as complete solutions
               : Be able to accept negative Modulo (currently not integrated)
               : Make modulo calculations more efficient by simplying
                   before evaluating via EEA Algorithm
               : MAIN UPDATE: Make into webpage with a clean interface
