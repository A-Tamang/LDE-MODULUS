# LDE-MODULUS
A Linear Diophantine/Modulus Equation Solver made in Python. 

[Work in Progress]

This program can evaluate any LDE (Linear Diophantine Equations
and Modulus Equations and provide a solution (or declares that
there is no solution to be found). To use, simply run the 
run the program on PythonIDLE (larger screen for text to 
show up) and follow the instructions.

Future updates : Show "particular solutions" as well as complete solutions
               : Be able to accept negative Modulo (currently not integrated)
               : Make modulo calculations more efficient by simplying
                     before evaluating via EEA Algorithm
               : MAIN UPDATE: Make into webpage with a clean interface
