# LDE-MODULUS

[Work in Progress]
A Linear Diophantine/Modulus Equation Solver made in Python. 

Purpose:

             This program can evaluate any LDE (Linear Diophantine Equation)
             or Modulus Equation and provide a solution (or declare that
             there is no solution to be found). 

Instructions:

             To use, simply run the run the program on PythonIDLE (as it has a larger 
             screen for text to show up) and follow the instructions.

Future updates:
             
             i) Show "particular solutions" as well as complete solutions
             
            ii) Be able to accept negative Modulo (currently not integrated)
             
           iii) Make modulo calculations more efficient by simplying
                  before evaluating via EEA Algorithm
                  
            iv) Make into webpage with a clean interface
